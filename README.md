## Issues

Caution, this module port is in an early stage. Do not use on production,
 yet. Full functionality isn't guaranteed, but testing is highly appreciated.

Bugs and Feature requests should be reported in the
 [Issue Queue](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/shib_auth/issues)

## Current Maintainers

- [Indigoxela](https://github.com/indigoxela)
- Seeking additional maintainers

Progress has stalled for two reasons:

1. The maintainer has no immediate need for it
2. Until now the maintainer wasn't able to set up a functioning Shibboleth
test environment (help welcome and highly appreciated)
